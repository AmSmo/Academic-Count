# Academic-Count
Word count explorer for journal publications.  Will have options to exclude, tables, figures and in text citations.

Some friends who constantly submit journal articles always have to figure out specific word counts when submitting to certain places.  Ideally this will be a tool to easily figure out where your word counts are, excluding in text citations if need be, all without having to cut and paste your article.  Will eventually have reports functionality to tell you what was included and why.  

Some issues I have come across about word counts in general is that they vary from Word and Pages and other word processing programs (most common differences include words with hyphens and those separated with a "/".  Also those programs handle reference word counts differently than body word counts, so it can be very clunky.

Hopefully this would be a go to tool, as well as adaptable if people find they need different variables covered.


NOTE: 5-18-2020, this is very early in the process and just working on a specific article right now, but if you have articles where you would like to test I would be thrilled to work on them.  Eventually will also have a GUI interface instead of just commandline style.  Everything is always a work in progress so please stay tuned.

Note: 5-21-2020, After talking with some friends to make it a more testable solution, I am going to try to build a django web app.  Since as of right now I have no experience with Django I will be working on this project but much slower, again if you have an article you wish to test please reach out and I will gladly take the time to work on it.
