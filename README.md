# CountSci
Word count explorer for scientific journal publications.  Will have options to exclude, tables, figures and in text citations.

Some friends who constantly submit journal articles always have to figure out specific word counts when submitting to certain
places.  Ideally this will be a tool to easily figure out where your word counts are, excluding in text citations if need be,
all without having to cut and paste your article.  Will eventually have reports functionality to tell you what was included and
why.  

Some issues I have come across about word counts in general is that they vary from Word and Pages and other word processing
programs (most common differences include words with hyphens and those separated with a "/".  Also those programs handle 
reference word counts differently than body word counts, so it can be very clunky.

Hopefully this would be a go to tool, as well as adaptable if people find they need different variables covered.
